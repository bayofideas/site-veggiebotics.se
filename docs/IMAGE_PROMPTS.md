## Notes for Image Generation

1. **Consistency**: Maintain the lime-green (#a3e635) accent across all images
2. **Quality**: Always request 4K or highest resolution available
3. **Lighting**: Prefer soft, natural lighting mixed with grow light accents
4. **Style**: Product photography and lifestyle editorial hybrid
5. **Mood**: Calm, confident, premium, not overly dramatic
6. **Avoid**: 
   - Cluttered backgrounds
   - Visible messy cables
   - Overly futuristic/sci-fi aesthetics
   - Cartoon or illustrated styles
   - Cheap-looking components
   - "Urban farming" hippie aesthetic
